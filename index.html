        <h2>Reading Respond</h2>
        <p>The author delves into the metaphorical and philosophical aspects of personal websites. She compares her website to a "mobile home next to a river of knowledge", which I think reflects many of the characteristics of a personal website, such as mobility, adaptability and evolving nature. The author introduces a novel concept of the website as a living entity that 'grows' according to the owner's experiences, learning and interactions. I find it refreshing to see how designers, for example, unconsciously use their latest technology when building their personal websites. And after a while, if their aesthetic preference changes, they update the site accordingly. So I think a website can be seen not only as a static portfolio, but also as a dynamic response to a designer's interests and personal growth.</p>
